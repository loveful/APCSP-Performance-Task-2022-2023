# asmchess
This code creates a command-line interface (CLI) for a game of chess, using x86 assembly language. The game is played in the terminal, and the board is displayed using ASCII characters to represent the different pieces.

This was created as a self-challenge for the AP Computer Science Principles Performance Task, as well as to test the limitations of the people working at College Board.
